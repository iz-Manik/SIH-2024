## Project Overview

This repository contains the project submission for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024 by Team NEXTECH. The project addresses the problem statement "SAR Image Colorization for Comprehensive Insight using Deep Learning Model," aiming to develop an innovative solution for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR imagery through colorization using deep learning models.

## Problem Statement

**Description:**  
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is rich in structural and textural information but lacks the intuitive appeal of color, which can provide more comprehensive insights for spaceborne applications. SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data.

The project aims to develop a novel DL model to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. The model will be trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, with a focus on minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images. The challenge is to create a DL system that accurately predicts and applies colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable.

**Challenge:**  
The challenges require innovative approaches in data pre-processing, DL model design, and evaluation methodologies to develop effective and reliable SAR image colorization solutions.

**Usage:**  
The goal is to improve the usability of SAR data in applications like geological studies and environmental monitoring by providing more intuitive and informative visual representations.

**Users:**  
Remote Sensing Image Analysts

**Available Solutions:**  
Existing Deep Learning models have been proposed and used but their performance is not satisfactory.

**Desired Outcome:**  
DL based SAR Image Colorization Software.
